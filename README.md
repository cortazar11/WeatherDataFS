# WeatherDataFS
Basically in this app, apart of getting weather data, you can login if you have a google account.Once logged in, you can buy credits at one dollar per credit and with those credits you can create a Survey made out of a title , the subject, a body and the recipient where you can place all the emails you want to direct to.
You can check a list of all the emails you sent.
I followed the course of Full Stack Application of Stephen Grider in Udemy and use Stripe and Sendgrid services.
